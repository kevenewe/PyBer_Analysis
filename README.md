# PyBer_Analysis 
A data set was provided that had data for cities that are Urban, Suburban, and rural.  The data was inspected to see which type of city had the most ride sharing, what the average fares were, and how many drivers were in each area. 

## Ride Sharing in Urban Areas
Ride sharing takes place more frequently in the urban area because of the greater number of people and opportunities to ride share. 
the following figure shows a scatter plot of average fares and total number of rides in a city.
