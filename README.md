# PyBer_Analysis 
A data set was provided that had data for cities in the following types: Urban, Suburban, and rural. The data was inspected to see which type of city had the most ride sharing, what the average fares were, and how many drivers were in each area. 

## Ride Sharing in the different city Types
Ride sharing takes place more frequently in the urban area because of the greater number of people and opportunities to ride share. the following figure shows a scatter plot of average fares and total number of rides in a city.

The following figure shows the percentages of rides in each type of city.

### Fares 
Fares per ride were higher in the rural areas, second was suburban areas, and the lower fares were in the urban

Although the individual fares were higher in the rural areas, the total amounts for the fairs in the different city types show that the total fares were proportional to the number of rides given in each type of city.

### Number of Drivrs

The number of drivers was proportional to the number of rides given. Urban cities had the largest number of drivers and Urban areas had the least number of drivers.

The average fare per driver was also higher in the urban areas. 

### Summary
The number of rides provided depends on two factors first is the size of the city, and second is the number of drivers. The data shows that the rural areas have less opportunities for ride shares, however the fees are higher for those the rides shared. The data shows a correlation with the greater demand for ride shares in urban cities increases the number of drivers and lowers the overall cost of the fares. Suburban cities and urban cities overlap in number of rides between 15 and 25with fares being higher by $10 to $15 higher on average for suburban fares.

What is not known is there a direct correlation to the total population sizes of the different city types. For example, do the larger cities in each city type influence the number of fare opportunities? Does the proximity of suburban & rural areas to Urban areas have an impact on the total number and average fare type.
